            <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Bassey, a Nigerian and a passionate learner currently
                studying
                Web Design and
                Development through BYU–Pathway Worldwide. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical
                Engineering,
                which has strengthened my analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, and
                structured approach to
                learning.

                My engineering background influences how I approach web development—combining
                efficiency,
                functionality, and creativity to build user-friendly digital experiences.
                Transitioning into tech
                has allowed me to merge logical reasoning with design, user experience, and modern
                web tools.

                As the eldest of four children, I have developed strong leadership skills,
                responsibility, and
                resilience. Beyond academics, I enjoy cooking, swimming, basketball, reading,
                traveling, biking, and
                hiking, which help me stay balanced and creative.

                I aspire to become a professional web developer and designer, working globally to
                create accessible,
                visually appealing, and impactful digital solutions while continuously learning and
                growing by the special grace of our Heavenly Father.

            <img src="images/machu-picchu.jpg" alt="Peru's Machu Picchu">
            <p>Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel in southern Peru, located in the Eastern
                Cordillera on a
                mountain ridge 2,430 meters (7,978 ft) above sea level. It lies in the Machupicchu
                District of
                Urubamba Province, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of Cusco, overlooking
                the Sacred Valley.The site is renowned for its sophisticated dry-stone construction,
                agricultural terraces, and ceremonial structures, which reflect the advanced
                engineering and architectural skills of the Inca civilization. Today, Machu Picchu
                is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world and a UNESCO World
                Heritage Site, attracting millions of visitors each year.
