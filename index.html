            <p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Bassey, and I am a Nigerian currently studying Web Design
                and Development
                through the BYU–Pathway Worldwide online program. I am excited about this journey
                and highly
                motivated to become a professional web developer and designer in the near future.

                I hold a first degree in Mechanical Engineering and am the eldest of four children,
                a role that has
                helped me develop strong responsibility, leadership, and discipline. My transition
                into web
                development is driven by my passion for technology, creativity, and problem-solving.

                Outside of academics, I enjoy cooking, swimming, basketball, reading, traveling,
                biking races, and
                hiking in the mountains. I aspire to work as a professional web developer and
                designer for a
                reputable company anywhere in the world, contributing meaningfully without
                geographical limitations.
